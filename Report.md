Short (~250 words) abstract of the concrete data science problem and how the solutions addresses the problem.


## Introduction
An explanation of the problem and the motivation for solving it.
Data Scientist is one of the most popular jobs in the US. According to Harvard Business Review, Data Scientist is the sexist job of the 21st Century. On February 2, 2022, recruiting website Glassdoor released its annual ranking of the “50 Best Jobs in America for 2022”, and Data Scientist is the #3 Best job in America, with a Median Base Salary $120,000. In this project, we want to present a clear picture of the salary distribution in the US, provide guidelines to the Data Scientist applicants, and help them land a satisfying job.

## Future Work
Currently, we only have no more than 800 pieces of data from glassdoor. These data can not represent the salary distribution across the US, not to mention the world. We hope that we can get more data from other resources like Linkedin and Indeed. We believe that our application can be more persuasive with more data. Also, we don't provide all the summarized information for our users. For example, the degree requirement can not be visualized because we have too many 'na' in our data. We believe that we can provide more summarized information with more data, which will give our users a more clear vision of the salaries of Data scientists.

On the other hand, we provide limited functions for our users. The users can provide more data to help our model predict better, like the number of years he/she has worked and their previous salary. We will include these parameters into consideration in the future.
